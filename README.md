# Dolphin Armor Bundle üê¨
(Dolphin Armor Bundle = Datapack + RessourcePack)

Dolphins drop dolphin skin, with that you can craft an armor.  
If you wear all the pieces of armor, you will have the dolphin's grace and water breathing effect without time limit.  
The effects will disappear, if you remove a piece of armor, in 30 seconds.
